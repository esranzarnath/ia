--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Movement and interaction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can move in eight directions by using the numpad keys in this manner:

   7 8 9
    \|/
   4-5-6
    /|\
   1 2 3

The '5' key or period key (.) makes you wait for a turn.

You can also use the arrow keys for movement. To move diagonally using the arrow keys, hold shift or ctrl:
   Shift + left  = up left
   Shift + right = up right
   Ctrl  + left  = down left
   Ctrl  + right = down right

Page up, Page down, Home, and End can also be used for diagonal movement.

Vi keys (or "Rogue keys") are also supported:

   y k u
    \|/
   h-.-l
    /|\
   b j n

Certain things can be interacted with by moving into them (i.e. by "bumping" them), for example:
   * Move into enemies to attack them
   * Move into closed doors, chests, cabinets, etc to open them
   * Move into fountains to drink from them


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. The interface
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is an example of how the interface lines can look:

   HP:9/16 SPI:8/8 INS:45%/12% ARM:1 L:491  } M1911 Colt 1d8+4 60% 5/7
   LVL:1 NXT:60 DLVL:2 T:264 ENC:40%        / 7 Throwing Knives 2d4 60%
   Blind Diseased

From left to right, the first line displays Hit Points (current/max), Spirit Points (see section 4: "Spirit and spell casting"), shock/insanity (see section 5: "Insanity"), armor Points (each point reduces your received physical damage by 1), remaining turns for your Electric Lantern (this number is colored yellow while the Lantern is activated), and your wielded weapon (damage, accuracy, and ammo)

The second line displays character level, experience points needed for next level, dungeon level, turn number, encumbrance from carrying items (from 100% you move at half speed, and from 125% you cannot move at all), and your thrown weapon.

The third line displays properties currently affecting you. This can be temporary properties (e.g. from spells), permanent intrinsic properties, or properties granted by wearing or wielding items.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Spirit and spell casting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to your physical and mental health, you have an "essence" - or Spirit - to preserve. If you lose all your Spirit, you are dead.

Your Spirit is shown like this:
   SPI:Current/Max

Some characters have the ability to cast spells intrinsically without using external aids - the Occultist can learn spells from reading manuscripts for example. Casting spells "naturally" will drain some of your spirit.

To cast intrinsic spells, you can press [X] (upper case) to open a menu for selecting which spell to cast. In this menu you can see the Spirit cost per spell (the cost is a range of values, and the spirit drained is a random value in this range), and roughly how much Shock it will cause.

As a shortcut, you can also press [x] (lower case) to immediately re-cast the previous spell (this is useful for spells typically cast repeatedly, such as Darkbolt).

When casting a spell, you will get a warning if the spell could potentially drain all your remaining Spirit. You can then press y/n to attempt casting or abort. Casting the spell in this situation is a gamble with death, but it could be worth it if you are desperate.

There are also other ways you can lose your Spirit, for example some monsters can drain your Spirit with their attacks.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Insanity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed man who stood behind him. Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my eyes. The man behind me - the only one of the party older than I - croaked the hackneyed "My God!" in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing the more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first."-H.P. Lovecraft, "Rats in the Walls"

Certain events in this game affects the sanity and composure of your character. One of the main threats to your mental health are the various horrifying creatures that inhabit the game world. When inside your view, some creatures may cause a vague unease, while others are very disturbing to behold. You also lose sanity from using occult powers, and other bizarre events. Finally, there is a slow perpetual draining of your sanity from exploring and dwelling in this ancient haunted dungeon.

Your state of Insanity is shown by two percentage values like this:
   INS:X%/Y%

The X-value represents your current state of shock, stress and paranoia, while the Y-value represents your long term Insanity.

When various disturbing events occur, the shock value rises. When shock hits 100%, the following happens:
   * You do something (scream, laugh, faint, babble, gain a phobia...)
   * The shock value is restored a bit
   * Insanity rises

Each time you travel to the next dungeon level, half your shock is restored (you have escaped the horrors above, and is bestowed with a sense of progress).

If your Insanity reaches 100%, you are hopelessly lost, and the game is over.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Sneaking and backstabbing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monsters unaware of your presence have a blue background in their map icon. This is their default mode. While in this state they may roam the map, but they will not actively search for you or purposefully attack you.

For each turn you spend in a monsters visual area, there is a certain chance it will notice you. Most monsters also have other methods of searching, such as listening. Monsters will also disturb nearby monsters when becoming aware, alerting them to your presence.

When you stay out of an aware monsters vision for a certain number of turns (and nothing else alerts it), it will "forget" about you. The number of turns this takes depends on the monster; A simple animal may only care for a couple of turns after it loses sight, while a human will remain aware longer.

If you attack an unaware opponent in melee, the attack gets a big bonus to damage and hit chance.

Medium and heavy melee weapons will make noise on attacks, so a light weapon might be more ideal for a stealthy combat approach.
